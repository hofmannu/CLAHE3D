# CLAHE3D

A three dimensional contrast enhancement code written in `C++` and `CUDA`. Works as standalone C++ application or through a MATLAB interface specified as a `*.mex` file. Histograms are calculated for subvolumes of definable size. The spacing of the histogram bins can be chosen independently of the bin size. Afterwards, Each histogram is then converted into a normalized cummulative distribution function. By interpolating the inverted distribution function for each subregion, we can enhance the local contrast in a volumetric image.

Beside the basic functionality of CLAHE3D I started implementing a few more volume processing functions which can improve the outcome of CLAHE3D such as

*  meanfiltering of volumes running on multiple cores on the CPU
*  gaussian filtering
*  volumetric medianfiltering
*  thresholding of volumes (similar to clip limit)
*  normalization to custom range

# Cloning and Dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hofmannu/CLAHE3D.git
cd CLAHE3D
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To use the GUI or CUDA support, there are a few more things to install

## Ubuntu

*  `git`: obviously
*  `nvidia-cuda-toolkit`: ships nvcc and other tools required to compile CUDA code
*  `cmake`: required for compilation
*  `g++`: compiler of choice
*  `libsdl2-dev`: required to display stuff
*  `libhdf5-dev`: required to save and load from h5 file format
*  `libglfw3-dev`: also for display stuff

With those libraries installed it should work. A few libraries might not be matching with your OS path to them (e.g. not finding header files).

## ArchLinux

# Installation / Compiling

*  `cuda`: CUDA toolkit

The `CPU` code does not depend on any library. For the `GPU` version you need to have `CUDA` installed on your system. For the GUI there come a few additional dependencies. The code is compiled using `cmake`. You can use the code also with GPU support and the functions will then be accelerated on the GPU (requires CUDA and CUDA capable device). To compile with GPU support, change the flag `USE_CUDA` in the main `CMakeLists.txt` to `TRUE`. Same is true if you want to use the ImGui based graphical user interface (basically a simple slicing and execution interface).

```bash
mkdir Debug
cd Debug 
cmake ..
make all
ctest 
./main_gui
```

To run a throughout test of the procedures, run `ctest` from the `Debug` subfolder after compilation.

# Feature request / bug report

Feel free to contact me if you need the addition of a feature or if you want to report a bug. Next step of this project is going to be a `CUDA` capable parallelized version of the code.
